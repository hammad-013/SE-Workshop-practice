# Student Record Management System

Simple console-based C++ app for student records. Git/GitHub collab project—all in one `main.cpp`.

## Features
- Add/view/update/delete records.
- Search/sort.
- Save/load from `data/students.txt`.

## Project Structure
- `main.cpp`: All code (edit your section only!).
- `data/`: Storage.

## Setup & Build
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Student-Record-Management-System.git`
2. Build: `g++ main.cpp -o student_mgr`
3. Run: `./student_mgr` (Linux/Mac) or `student_mgr.exe` (Windows).

## Collaboration
- Branch: `git checkout -b feature/[your-task]` (e.g., `feature/file-crud`).
- Edit **only your section** in `main.cpp` (search for "MEMBER X").
- Commit: `git commit -m "feat: implement file load"`.
- PR to `main`—test build first (@lead for review).
- Conflicts? Edit same lines? Discuss in PR.

## Team Tasks (Edit These Sections in main.cpp)
- **Group Lead (You)**: Repo setup, PR reviews, README tweaks, final integration.
- **Member 2**: "// MEMBER 2: FILE & CRUD" (load/save + add/update/delete).
- **Member 3**: "// MEMBER 3: DISPLAY & INTERFACE" (view/search/sort + menu).

Student struct is at top—use it everywhere.
